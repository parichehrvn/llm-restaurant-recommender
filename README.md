## Overview
Reading restaurant reviews can be overwhelming.They are often long, detailed, and time-consuming to go through. This chatbot, built on the **Yelp Open Dataset**, acts as a userâ€™s assistant by analyzing reviews and providing clear, concise insights. It can recommend restaurants, answer specific questions, and highlight both positive and negative aspects of a restaurant to simplify the restaurant selection process.
It leverages **Elasticsearch** for semantic search, **Gemini LLM** for natural language generation, and **LlamaIndex** for RAG orchestration. The system is built with **FastAPI** for backend services and **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.
The project is fully **containerized** with **Docker**, with automated deployment pipelines via **GitHub Actions**.
